# Google Books Search
**Deployed Application can be viewed [here](https://book-search331.herokuapp.com/)**  
This application allows the user to search for a book, which it then displays on the UI. The books are sourced from the Google Books API. The user can then save book information to a database as a 'favorites' type list. The user can view their saved books on a seperate page and delete from their saved list as required.  
This application utilizes the MERN stack (Mongo, Express, React and Node).

In this activity, you'll create a new React-based Google Books Search app. This assignment requires you to create React components, work with helper/util functions, and utilize React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. You'll also use Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.
